# Asteroids
Asteroids game in C++

This game uses SDL to load and handle resources. I started by reviewing [these SDL tutorials](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php), from where I got the SDL_Texture loading code and the first version of the main loop.

This game is just an exercise in nostalgia, because I started as a professional developer with C++ more than 20 years ago, but I haven't touched a line C++ code in 15 years.

I think that game development, when done almost from scratch, is one of the best ways to learn a programming language. This usually means avoiding any game engine available (there are lots for any given language), and reinventing the wheel: finding out how to make a lot of basic tasks, and comparing them with existing standard solutions.

Use this code at your own risk.
